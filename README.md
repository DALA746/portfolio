# MY PORTFOLIO

Thanks to that project I've learned a lot about CSS. First of all, everything is boxes and you can put more boxes in the boxes. 
I've learned more about how to use Flexbox especially properties like flex-wrap and justify-content. 

I need to be better at planning my work before the start and think thought how my website should look from a CSS perspective. Maybe even skis on paper and have this planning visually. 
At the beginning of this project, everything felt confusing to me, especially the CSS part. But at the end of the week, I am proud of what I've created.

I've tested my wesite with Chrome Devtools Lighthouse and got accessibility of 81. Then I've fixed some issues with links by additing rel="noopener" to the a tag and converting all images to webp format ( https://convertio.co/)
